# PrismJS PseudoCode Highlighter

This is a  plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

## Main Features

This plugin primarily works with codeblocks in Markdown. It works as a highlighter for PseudoCode, a standardized pseudocode language with an outlined syntax. Keywords, such as NEW, PRIVATE or PUBLIC, and CLASS, along with dot notation are now recognized and highlighted their respective color by the codeblock.
